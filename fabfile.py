# ~/fabfile.py
#
# This is an example fabfile for the fabgis project.
#
# Warning: These are examples and you should always test any proposed
# automated deployments thoroughly before trying them on a production server.
# I strongly recommend using vagrant for this kind of sandbox testing.
#
# To use this fabfile, you should first install fabric and fabtools. The
# requirements file provided in this directory will let you do this easily by
# typing e.g.
#
# sudo pip install requirements.txt
#
# To install vagrant, download the latest version from
# http://downloads.vagrantup.com/ (use the packages they provide rather than
# apt as the ubuntu package is old).
#
# Assuming you are using a vagrant sandbox, you can use the Vagrantfile
# supplied with this repo to create your vagrant box. Note that there is a
# one time download of around 400mb to add the base image to your boxes
# collection. This command will initialise your vagrant sandbox.
#
# vagrant up
#
# Now you are ready to run your first fabgis task! Lets install QGIS master
# and PostgreSQL into our vagrant sandbox!
#
# fab vagrant build_server
#
# Now go off and have a cup of tea, when it is done your vagrant box should
# have everything set up. If you would like to try out your new QGIS you
# could do something like this:
#
# ssh localhost -p 2222 -X /usr/local/qgis-master/bin/qgis
#
# That will run your newly built QGIS instance and forward the display back
# to your local X-xerver.

    Notes:

    The installed server will have QGIS from master set up on it and postgres
    installed with postgis and a template spatial database created. A default
    database called 'gis' will be created too.

        e.g.

            fab -H root@foo create_user
            fab -H foo build_server

        You need to run the create_user task separately to bootstrap the
        creation of your user on the remote host.
